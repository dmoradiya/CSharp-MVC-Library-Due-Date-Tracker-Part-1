# ASP.NET Core Practice - Library Due Date Tracker Day 1
## Introduction
This practice is meant to challenge your mastery of ASP.NET Web Application (Model - View - Controller) and how well you are able to use MVC to create a CRUD application. Your goal in this practice is to create a tool that will help you keep track of all the books that are checked out of a library. This is a cumulative activity. You will be adding onto this code for consequent practice.
